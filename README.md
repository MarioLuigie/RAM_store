## Introduction

**HealthCare** is a modern medical application that gives clinic patients full control over their health. With this app, users have access to their account, where they can quickly and conveniently schedule, edit, and cancel appointments with their doctors. The app also offers a clear dashboard where patients can monitor their health status, check test results, and sign up for additional consultations or diagnostic tests. HealthCare is the perfect solution for those who value easy access to essential medical information and want to actively manage their health.

## Technologies

This project is built using modern full-stack web development technologies to ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability. Below is a list of the key technologies and libraries used:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A powerful React-based framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications. Version `14.2.7` is used for optimized performance and features like dynamic routing, SSR (Server-Side Rendering), and API routes.

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on component-based architecture and efficient updates. This project uses React version `18` for features such as Concurrent Mode and Suspense.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability by catching errors at compile time. The project uses TypeScript for improved developer experience and scalability.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development. Tailwind CSS, combined with `tailwind-merge` and `tailwindcss-animate`, helps create consistent and responsive designs with ease.

- **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)**: A flexible and efficient form management library. Paired with `Zod` for schema-based form validation, it simplifies handling forms and validation in React.

- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)**: A collection of unstyled, accessible components such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns, used to build a customized and accessible UI.

- **[Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)**: A backend-as-a-service platform used for managing databases, authentication, and storage in this project. The `node-appwrite` SDK simplifies integration with Appwriteâ€™s API.

- **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)**: A collection of beautiful, customizable icons used for enhancing the user interface.

- **[React Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/)**: A simple, flexible library for handling file uploads via drag-and-drop, improving the user experience for file management.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: A tool for identifying and fixing potential issues in JavaScript code. The project includes ESLint with Next.js-specific rules to enforce coding standards and ensure consistent quality.

This combination of technologies enables the project to be fast, responsive, and scalable, while also ensuring a high level of developer productivity and user experience.
